<h2>Description</h2>
<p>I make this cinnamon tea every now and then, when I pull out the German china tea set my mother-in-law brought home from one of her trips. It makes me feel special, and I can take pleasure in remembering her as I savor each sip.</p>
<p>I like cinnamon stick tea in the afternoon, because itâ€™s warm and comforting, and there is no caffeine! Try it with a lemon slice, and a drizzle of honey, or use whatever sweetener you prefer.</p>
